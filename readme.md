Cordova Bower Gulp Template for Visual Studio 2015
==================================================

A project template to be a base for a fairly complex Cordova application.  For use with Visual Studio 2015 but should work with Visual Studio 2013 but the bower/gulp steps will have to be manually run.

[Blog post with a bit more detail](http://www.mikemengell.com/javascript/improved-cordova-project-template-for-visual-studio-2015-adding-bower-and-gulp)

Project Dependencies
--------------------

* Bower for JavaScript package management
* Gulp for build steps
* AngularJS for SPA framework

Linting
-------

Included is ESLint configured with some basic rules.  ESLint is set to run with the watch task.  It is only monitoring JavaScript files within the app folder.

RoadMap
-------

I will create a project template as soon as an outstanding bug in VS2015 is resolved.

Want more roadmap?  What do you want? TypeScript? Angular2? Different SPA frameworks?  Some API examples? Azure Mobile Services Integration?

Ping me.
